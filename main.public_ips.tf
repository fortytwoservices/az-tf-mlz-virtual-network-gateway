# Azure deletes no public IP address a gateway uses (PublicIPAddressCannotBeDeleted). Terraform destroys a
# removed or renamed address before it updates the gateway, unless the address is create_before_destroy:
# then the gateway moves to the new set first (active-active to active-standby, a third address for
# point-to-site removed) and the old address goes last. A module call cannot set that, but Terraform
# passes create_before_destroy on to whatever a create_before_destroy resource depends on; this resource
# exists for that only. The gateway itself stays destroy-before-create: a virtual network holds one VPN
# gateway, so a replacement must delete the old one first. Cost: an address replaced under the same name
# is created while the old one still exists, so it needs a new name.
